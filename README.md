- metadata has been revised to include also a config file needed to the data manager to streamline the importing of new entries (importing.yalm) that needs to be filled in
- step 7 for simulations_analysis has been revised to include the right python module to use (python2.7)
- from now on on new entries we will only support data collected with the saturation mutlist and using pancancer_clinvar_saturation.py for cancermuts
